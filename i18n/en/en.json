Ships can be arranged vertically or horizontally but cannot touch each other. The objective of the game is to destroy the entire enemy fleet. Each player has 30 seconds for their turn. A hit allows the player to continue the attack, while a miss passes the turn to the opponent. The game continues until one player's fleet is completely destroyed.",

The winner receives the pot, which includes their own funds and the opponent's bet. Akronix takes a 5% commission for organizing the battle."
